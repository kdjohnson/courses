# courses-ada

## Using demo data

To run this project locally (with no backend), navigate to `public/index.html` and change `is_demo` to `true`. This will provide the frontend with realistic course and calendar data.

## Running React code
1. Make sure you have NodeJS and NPM installed
2. Run an `npm i && npm start` in the root of the project. This will start the frontend on `localhost:3000`
